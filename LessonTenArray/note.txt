Array ----are special variables that enable you hold mutiple variables at the same time 
Array can hold any type of data 


Methods to add Items in an array ..... You use bracket notation to acces elements  in array 
array name[index]
indexing starts from 0 to going forward

In Arrays we have two types of methods --->  Distructive and Non Distractive

Distractive > means modifying original array
          .push() --> add elements at the end of the array
          .pop() ---> delete at the end of an array
          .unshift() ---->  adds at the beginning of the array
          .shift() ---> delete an item from the beginning of an array
          .splice(1, 3) ----> modifying an array by removing, addingreplaces an existing element in an array
                        adds  and deletes an existing element

Non-Destractive methods>  it does not affect the original array , sort of it creates a copy  
          .slice ---->  this creates an array from a specific index to a certtain indexing


Iteration In array 

for loop; for(initializing) condition, add/negate

.forEach()
you start with the array name then .forEach
