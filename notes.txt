JS for web interactions 

For you to use Java scripts you have to have
Node modules

So you have to install nvm  first 
By default npm  (Our node package manager/module)

how do you store data in Javascript == we use variables (Containers which we can use for later use)

How to declare variables
      1. var    (it can be accesed with the codes ) you can redclare its more of a global scoped varianle
      2. let      ()  can be updated within the function scope and now called local variable but not redeclared
      3. const    ()

Variables data types
  * numbers (intergers)
  * strings (textual data)  Prinmitive data type which is primary datatype
  * boolean true or false aguments
  * unidentified.. there is no value 
implicit (done automatically)   explicit(this is done manually you do it ) eg number(5) == "5"
Comparisons in Javascript
- loose equality (implicit changes a data type to the favourite)
- loose inequality
- strict equality
- strict inequality

Conditions

function - block of reusable  code
function <name of function>
global scope---- s accesible anywghere in your code  (var let)
function scope ----- accesed inside the function but not anywghere eg the let variable
block scope --------- in a specific block anything inside the curly brases

parameters are like place holders 
arguments
